My first PCB design from tutorial 

The nine steps for designing a PCB are:

1) Create a Schematic Symbol
2) Schematic Capture
3) Create a Footprint
4) Associate Footprints and Generate Netlist
5) Place Parts and Define Outline
6) Board Layout
7) Generate Gerbers and Order Boards
8) Generate BOM and Order Parts
9) Solder Components to the PCB

The design is just iteration of these steps back and forth.
